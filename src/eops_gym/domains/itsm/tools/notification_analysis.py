"""Notification-analysis tools (4) — faithful port of the ITSM MCP's notification_analysis category.

Pure read/aggregate tools over the ``notification`` table: count by incident / status / type,
and the average notifications per incident. Verified against the live MCP by the differential
conformance test.

NOTE: the original server has two quirks faithfully reproduced here (confirmed against the
oracle):

* ``count_notifications_by_status`` / ``count_notifications_by_type`` return ``{"metrics": {}}``
  when no filter is supplied, and when a filter *is* supplied they echo each requested value
  **upper-cased** with a count of ``0`` — the server groups stored (lower-case) values but
  matches them against the upper-cased filter, so the counts never line up. We mirror this
  exactly so the differential return matches.
* ``average_notifications_by_incident`` averages over the incidents that actually have at least
  one notification (the divisor excludes zero-notification incidents); it returns ``0.0`` when
  no in-scope incident has a notification, and rounds to two decimals.
